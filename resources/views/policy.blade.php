<li><strong>LEGAL BASIS FOR PROCESSING YOUR INFORMATION</strong></li>
</ol>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Our legal basis for collecting and using the personal information described above will depend on the personal information concerned and the specific context in which we collect it.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>However, we will normally collect personal information from you only (i) where we have your consent to do so, (ii) where we need the personal information to perform a contract with you, or (iii) where the processing is in our legitimate interests and not overridden by your rights. In some cases, we may also have a legal obligation to collect personal information from you.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>If we ask you to provide personal information to comply with a legal requirement or to perform a contract with you, we will make this clear at the relevant time and advise you whether the provision of your personal information is mandatory or not (as well as the possible consequences if you do not provide your information).</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>Similarly, if we collect and use your personal information in reliance on our legitimate interests (or those of any third party), we will make clear to you at the relevant time what those legitimate interests are.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<ol start="4">
<li><strong>SHARING YOUR INFORMATION</strong></li>
</ol>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>We may share your personal information with third parties when permitted by law including:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li>with your consent;</li>
<li>to our suppliers in order for them to help us provide our services to you, this includes:

<li>our provider of file storage and management services.</li>
</ol>
</li>

<li>if we sell or buy any business or assets, in which case we may disclose your information to the prospective seller or buyer of such business or assets, provided that they continue to use your information substantially in accordance with the terms of this Privacy Policy;</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li>if we are under a duty to disclose or share your information in order to comply with any legal obligation, or in order to enforce or apply our Terms and Conditions and other agreements; or to protect our rights, property, or safety, our users, or others. This includes exchanging information with other companies and organisations for the purposes of fraud protection and credit risk reduction.</li>

<p>Many of our external third parties are based inside the UK but processing of your personal data may involve a transfer of data outside the UK.</p>

<ol start="5">
<li><strong>RETENTION AND STORAGE OF YOUR INFORMATION</strong></li>
</ol>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>We only store your personal information for as long as we require it in order to fulfil the purpose for which it was collected or provided to us (unless a legal obligation requires us to keep it for longer).&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>All information is stored on our secure servers. When you register, we will ask you to choose a password which enables you to access the Website and the Services. You are responsible for keeping this password confidential. We ask you not to share this password with anyone.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>Servers used by the Ten Academy are located in&nbsp;the United Kingdom. We have put in place technical and organisational security measures to prevent the loss or unauthorised access of your personal information. However, whilst we have used our best efforts to ensure the security of your data, please be aware that we cannot guarantee the security of information transmitted over the internet.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>We retain personal information we collect from you where we have an ongoing legitimate business need to do so (for example, to provide you with a service you have requested or to comply with applicable legal, tax or accounting requirements). When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal information, we will either delete or anonymise it or, if this is not possible (for example, because your personal information has been stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your personal information and isolate it from any further processing until deletion is possible.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>

<li><strong>CHILDREN&rsquo;S PRIVACY</strong></li>
</ol>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>We strongly believe in protecting the privacy of children who are below the age of 13 years. When our users are registering to the Website, we ask for the date of birth to determine whether the user is age 13 or under. When we intend to collect personal information from children under 13 years old, we take additional steps to protect their privacy, including:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>In accordance with our practice, obtaining consent from parents for the collection of personal information from their children, or for sending information about our products and services directly to their children;</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>Notifying parents about our information practices with regard to children, including the types of personal information we may collect from children, the uses to which we may put that information, and whether and with whom we may share that information;</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>Limiting children&rsquo;s ability to purchase on the Website without the obtaining consent from parent&rsquo;s account;</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>Limiting our collection of personal information from children to no more than is reasonably necessary to participate in an online activity; and</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>Giving parents access or the ability to request access to personal information we have collected from their children and the ability to request that the personal information be changed or deleted.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In any instance that we collect personal information from a child, we will retain that information only so long as reasonably necessary to fulfil the activity request or allow the child to continue to participate in the activity, and ensure the security of our users and our services, or as required by law.</p>
